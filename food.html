            Carb overload coming right at you! Come lunch time in Cairo youâ€™ll

              for a hearty portion of one of Egyptâ€™s favourite street foods. This
              filling meal is made up of rice, macaroni and lentils, topped with
              tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and fried
              onions. Kushari's a perfect meal that is substantial, nutrient-packed and

          <h2>Ful and Tamia</h2>
          <p>
            Taameya and ful mudammas, which are essentially fava beans and
              falafel are the original Egyptian fast-foods. Theyâ€™re a staple of
              the Egyptian diet, mainly because theyâ€™re filling and use
              ingredients that are easily accessible in the country. The ful is
              made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a
              qedra. The ta-meya, which is an Egyptian falafel, is made out of
              crushed fava beans that is later made into a paste, then fried.
              Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however,
              Egypt is the actual origin of those delightful fried treats. A
              perfect dish for all you vegos!
